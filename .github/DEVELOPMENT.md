# Development Guide

Welcome to the development guide for `Himanshu-dot-dev`. Here, you'll find everything you need to get started with contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

Begin by [forking the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) from GitHub and [installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you haven't already. Then, clone your fork and install the project dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/Himanshu-dot-dev
cd Himanshu-dot-dev
npm install
```

> Tip: I recommend using VS Code as your editor for this project. This repository suggests a list of VS Code extensions that will enhance your development experience. Accepting the suggestion to install these extensions will greatly benefit your coding process.

## Code Formatting

I use Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across the codebase. Prettier should automatically format your files when you save in VS Code or commit changes.

If you need to format all files manually, run the following command:

```
npm format:write
```

## Running the Project Locally

To start the project on your local machine, use one of the following commands, depending on your setup:

`npm start`
or

`npm run dev`

## Development

See [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), then [`.github/DEVELOPMENT.md`](./.github/DEVELOPMENT.md).
Thanks!
